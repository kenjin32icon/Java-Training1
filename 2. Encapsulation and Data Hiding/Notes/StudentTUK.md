This Java code defines a class named `StudentTUK` that encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a student. Let's break down the code step by step:

### Package Declaration
```java
package Encalpsulation;
```
This line declares that the class `StudentTUK` belongs to the package named `Encalpsulation`. Note that there is a typo in the package name; it should likely be `Encapsulation`.

### Class Definition
```java
public class StudentTUK {
```
This line defines a public class named `StudentTUK`. The `public` keyword means that this class can be accessed from other classes.

### Instance Variables
```java
private String name;
private String email;
private int regno;
private String course;
private int year;
```
These lines declare private instance variables (fields) for the class. The `private` access modifier means that these variables can only be accessed within the `StudentTUK` class. The variables are:
- `name`: a `String` to store the student's name.
- `email`: a `String` to store the student's email.
- `regno`: an `int` to store the student's registration number.
- `course`: a `String` to store the student's course.
- `year`: an `int` to store the student's year of study.

### Constructor
```java
public StudentTUK(String name, String email, int regno, String course, int year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    this.regno = regno;
    this.course = course;
    this.year = year;
}
```
This is a constructor for the `StudentTUK` class. It initializes the instance variables with the values passed as parameters when a new object of `StudentTUK` is created. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object's instance variables.

### Setter Methods
```java
public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
```
Similar setter methods are defined for `email`, `regno`, `course`, and `year`. These methods allow external classes to set the values of the private instance variables.

### Getter Methods
```java
public String getName() {
    return name;
}
```
Getter methods are defined for each instance variable, allowing external classes to retrieve their values.

### toString Method
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "StudentTUK{" +
            "name='" + name + '\'' +
            ", email='" + email + '\'' +
            ", regno=" + regno +
            ", course='" + course + '\'' +
            ", year=" + year +
            '}';
}
```
The `toString` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `StudentTUK` object. This method returns a formatted string that includes the values of the instance variables.

### Main Method
```java
public static void main (String[] args) {
    StudentTUK student1 = new StudentTUK("John Doe", "johndooe32@gmail.com", 12345, "Computer Science", 2);
    StudentTUK student2 = new StudentTUK("Jane Smith", "Janesmith32@gmail.com", 12345, "Computer Science", 2);

    System.out.println(student1);
    System.out.println(student2);
}
```
The `main` method is the entry point of the program. It creates two instances of the `StudentTUK` class (`student1` and `student2`) with specific values. It then prints the string representation of each student object using the `toString` method.

### Summary
In summary, this code defines a `StudentTUK` class that encapsulates student information, provides methods to set and get that information, and includes a constructor for initializing new student objects. The `main` method demonstrates how to create and display student objects. 

### Note
There is a small error in the constructor where the parameter name `coure` should be corrected to `course` to match the instance variable.
