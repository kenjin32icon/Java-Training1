**Program Analysis**

This Java program implements a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user, performs the corresponding mathematical operation, and displays the result.

### Key Components

1. **Importing Libraries**: The program starts by importing the `java.util.Scanner` class to read user input.
2. **Class Declaration**: A public static method named `main` is declared within a class called `CompleteSimpleCalculator`.
3. **User Input**:
	* Two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) are taken as input from the user using `Scanner.nextDouble()`. The first number represents the base operand, while the second number represents the secondary operand.
	* An operator (+, -, \*, /) is also obtained as a character input from the user using `scanner.next().charAt(0)`.

### Mathematical Operations

The program uses a switch statement to perform different mathematical operations based on the selected operator:

1. **Addition**: If the operator is '+', it adds `num1` and `num2`.
2. **Subtraction**: If the operator is '-', it subtracts `num2` from `num1`.
3. **Multiplication**: If the operator is '*', it multiplies `num1` by `num2`.
4. **Division**:
	* If the second operand (`num2`) is not zero, it divides `num1` by `num2`. Otherwise, an error message is displayed and the operation flag (`validOperation`) is set to false.

### Result Display

If the mathematical operation was valid (i.e., no errors occurred), the program prints the result in a formatted string using `System.out.println`.

**Code Quality**

The code follows good practices:

* It uses meaningful variable names.
* The switch statement makes it easy to add or modify operations without modifying the underlying logic.
* Error handling is implemented for division by zero.

However, there are some minor suggestions for improvement:

* Consider adding more descriptive error messages when invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input) occur.
* You could use a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions during user input or mathematical operations.
* The code uses magic numbers (0 and 1). Replace them with named constants to improve readability.

**Example Use Cases**

Here's an example interaction:

```
Simple Calculator
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0 = 10 + 5
```
