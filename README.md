# Lewis Kariuki Java Training Repo

Welcome to the **Lewis Kariuki Java Training Repository**! This repository contains simple Java programming examples focused on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It is designed for beginners eager to learn Java and understand fundamental software development principles.

## About This Repo

This training repository includes straightforward examples demonstrating essential Java OOP topics such as:

- Defining Classes and Objects  
- Constructors and Encapsulation  
- Inheritance and Polymorphism  
- Method Overriding  

These examples are ideal for self-study, classroom training, or as a refresher for basic Java OOP concepts.

## Getting Started

To run these examples on your local machine using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.  
2. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA;Community Version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) if you haven't already.  
3. Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new project or open the existing project directory containing the Java files.  
4. If you create a new project, make sure to select the appropriate JDK version.  
5. Once the project is set up, you can directly run the Java files by right-clicking on the file (e.g., `Main.java`) and selecting "Run 'Main.main()'".  
6. Alternatively, you can open a terminal within IntelliJ IDEA and compile the Java files using:  
   ```bash
   javac *.java
