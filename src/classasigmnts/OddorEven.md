Here's a breakdown of the `OddOrEven` Java code:

**Importing Libraries**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

This line imports the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package, which is used to read input from the user.

**Class Declaration**

```java
public class OddOrEven {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // code here
    }
}
```

* The `public` access modifier means that this class can be accessed from outside the package.
* The `static` keyword indicates that the `main` method belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. This is necessary because we're not creating a new object in the `main` method; instead, we're using the static context.

**Reading User Input**

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

This line creates a new `Scanner` object to read from the standard input (`System.in`). The `scanner` variable will be used to get user input throughout the program.

**Getting User Input**

```java
System.out.println("Enter an integer: ");
int number = scanner.nextInt();
```

* We print a message asking the user to enter an integer using `System.out.println`.
* We use the `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` object to read an integer from the input. The result is stored in the `number` variable.

**Determining Odd or Even**

```java
if (number % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println(number + " is even.");
} else {
    System.out.println(number + " is odd.");
}
```

* We use the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of dividing `number` by 2.
    + If the remainder is 0, it means that `number` is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In this case, we print "is even." using `System.out.println`.
    + Otherwise (i.e., if the remainder is not 0), we print "is odd."

**Closing the Scanner**

```java
scanner.close();
```

This line closes the `Scanner` object to free up system resources.

Here's a step-by-step example of how this code works:

1. The user runs the program and sees the prompt: "Enter an integer:"
2. They enter the number 10.
3. The scanner reads the input (10) and stores it in the `number` variable.
4. The modulo operator (`%`) is applied to find the remainder of dividing 10 by 2, which is 0.
5. Since the remainder is 0, the program prints "10 is even."
6. The scanner remains open until the user closes the program or manually stops it.

Note that this code assumes that the user will enter a valid integer value. If they enter something else (e.g., text), an `InputMismatchException` might be thrown.
