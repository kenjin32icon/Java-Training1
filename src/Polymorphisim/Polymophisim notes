Polymorphisism in OOP is when an object or method could be made to have different methods of
    implementing it an example of the code their is the main class -Animal-
 The main class has the method of -makeSound- that other new classes could implement by
    using the that -makeSound- method and overriding the the method with a new impementation that
    the programmer would choose.
